# Contributor License Agreement

When contributing to the following projects:

- [revoltchat/backend](https://github.com/revoltchat/backend)
- [revoltchat/frontend](https://github.com/revoltchat/frontend)

You may need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You can access the [individual CLA document here](CLA.md).

## How to Sign

If you're contributing for the first time and haven't already signed the CLA then the process is as follows:

1. After creating a pull request, a bot ([CLA Assistant Lite](https://github.com/contributor-assistant/github-action)) will prompt you to confirm and agree to the CLA.
2. If you agree to the CLA, then you can respond to the bot and confirm your agreement.
3. Your pull request can then be accepted.

You only need to sign the CLA once to be able to contribute to any Revolt project.

## Purpose

Implementing a CLA allows Revolt to:
- Ensure that all contributions are licensed appropriately under the project's license.
- Enforce the project's license when necessary.
- Keep options open for potential relicencing in future.
- Potentially implement customized anti-spam solutions for the main platform if required.

## Feedback Welcome

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or concerns about this process or the project, please don't hesitate to contact us. You can either open an issue on this repository or email us at contact@revolt.chat.
